FAN TRANSLATION GUIDE:
https://github.com/ncase/crowds#how-to-translate-this-thing

Hello fan-translaters! Thank you so, so much for your help.
I hope you know what you've gotten yourself into.
There's about 3600+ WORDS to translate, including
the Bonus Boxes and References.

To make things easier (or less painful, anyway) I've marked
what needs to be translated and how with big "TRANSLATE" comments.
Ctrl+F for "TRANSLATE" in uppercase to see what needs to be translated!

BUT BEFORE YOU TRANSLATE ANYTHING, DO THIS:
1) Look up the two-letter code of the language you're translating to:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
2) *COPY* index.html, and name the copy [two-letter-code].html
   For example: de.html, ar.html, zh.html, etc...
3) Translate *THAT* page. Do NOT modify the original index.html!

And once you're done, go to "translations.txt", and follow the
instructions there to let this game "know" your translation exists.

Good luck, and thanks again!

<3,
~ Nicky Case

<words id="intro">

	<br><br>

	Sir Isaac Newton was pretty sure he was a
	<br>
	smart cookie. I mean, after inventing calculus and
	<br>
	a theory of gravity, he should be clever enough to do
	<br>
	some financial investing, right? Anyway, long story short, he
	<br>
	lost $4,600,000 (in today's dollars) in the nationwide
	<br>
	speculation frenzy known as the South Sea Bubble of 1720.

	<br><br>

	As Mr. Newton later said: <i>“I can calculate the motion of
	<br>
	heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”</i>

	<next>yeah sucks for him <div class="rarr"></div> </next>

</words>

<words id="intro_2">

	<div style="height:0.5em"></div>

	Of course, that's not the only
	<br>
	time markets, institutions, or entire
	<br>
	democracies went haywire &mdash; the <i>madness</i> of
	<br>
	crowds. And yet, just when you lose hope in humanity,
	<br>
	you see citizens coordinating to rescue each other in
	<br>
	hurricanes, communities creating solutions to problems,
	<br>
	people fighting for a better world &mdash; the <i>wisdom</i> of crowds!

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	<b>But <i>why</i> do some crowds turn to madness, or wisdom?</b> No theory
	<br>
	can explain everything, but I think a new field of study,
	<br>
	<b>network science</b>, can guide us! And its core idea is this: to
	<br>
	understand crowds, we should look not at the <i>individual
	<br>
	people</i>, but at...

	<next>...their <i>connections.</i> <div class="rarr"></div> </next>

</words>

<!-- Networks -->

<words id="networks_tutorial_start">
	<b>Let's draw a network!</b>
	Each connection represents a friendship between two people:

<words id="networks_tutorial_connect">

<words id="networks_tutorial_disconnect">

	when you're done doodling and playing around,
	<next wiggle>let's continue <div class="rarr"></div> </next>

</words>

<words id="networks_threshold">

	Now, social connections are for more than just making pretty pictures.
	People <i>look to</i> their social connections to understand their world.
	For example, people look to their peers to
	find out <b>what % of their friends</b> (not counting themselves) are,
	say, binge-drinkers. <icon name="yellow"></icon>

<words id="networks_threshold_instruction">

	<br>

	For example, a 1991 study<ref id="drunk"></ref> showed that 
	“virtually all [college] students reported that their friends drank more than they did.”
	But that seems impossible!
	How can that be?
	Well, you're about to invent the answer yourself, by drawing a network.
	It's time to...

<words id="networks_puzzle">

	<b style="font-size:2em">PUZZLE TIME!</b>

<words id="networks_post_puzzle">

	What you just created is called The Majority Illusion<ref id="majority"></ref>,

	But people don't just passively <i>observe</i> others' ideas and behaviors,

	So now, let's look at something network scientists call...

	<next>“Contagions!” <div class="rarr"></div> </next>


</words>

<!-- Simple Contagions -->

<words id="simple_simple">
	<i>Let's put aside the "threshold" thing for now.</i>
	Below: we have a person <icon name="red"></icon> with some information.
	Some <i>mis</i>information. "Fake news", as the cool kids say.
	And every day, that person spreads the rumor, like a virus, to their friends.
	And they spread it to <i>their</i> friends. And so on.
	<br>
	<b>
	Start the simulation! <div class="darr"></div>
	(p.s: you can't draw <i>while</i> the sim's running)
	</b>
</words>

<words id="simple_simple_2">
	Note: despite the negative name, "contagions" can be good or bad (or neutral or ambiguous). 
	There's strong statistical evidence<ref id="contagion"></ref> that
	smoking, health, happiness, voting patterns, and cooperation levels
	are all "contagious" --
	and even some evidence that suicides<ref id="suicides"></ref> and mass shootings<ref id="shootings"></ref> are, too.
</words>

<words id="simple_simple_end">
	<next wiggle>well that's depressing <div class="rarr"></div> </next>
</words>

<words id="simple_cascade">
	Indeed it is.
	Anyway, <b>PUZZLE TIME!</b>
	<br>
	Draw a network &amp; run the simulation,
	so that <i>everyone</i> gets infected with the "contagion".
	<br>
	(new rule: you can't cut the <i>thick</i> connections)
</words>

<words id="simple_cascade_end">
	<next wiggle>fan-flipping-tastic <div class="rarr"></div> </next>
</words>

<words id="simple_post_cascade">
	This madness-spreading is called an <b>"information cascade"</b>.
	Mr. Newton fell for such a cascade in 1720.
	The world's financial institutions fell for such a cascade in 2008.<ref id="subprime"></ref>
	<br><br>
	However: <i>this simulation is wrong.</i>
	Most ideas <i>don't</i> spread like viruses.
	For many beliefs and behaviors, you need to be "exposed" to the contagion more than just once
	in order to be "infected".
	So, network scientists have come up with a new, better way to 
	describe how ideas/behaviors spread, and they call it...
	<next wiggle>“<i>Complex</i> Contagions!” <div class="rarr"></div> </next>
</words>

<!-- Complex Contagions -->

<words id="complex_complex">

	Let's bring back "thresholds" and the binge-drinking <icon name="yellow"></icon> example!
	When you played with this the first time, people didn't change their behavior.

	<br><br>

	Now, let's simulate what happens if people start drinking
	<i>when 50%+ of their friends do!</i> 
	<b>Before you start the sim, ask yourself what you think <i>should</i> happen.</b>

	<br><br>
	
	<b>Now, run the sim, and see what actually happens! <div class="rarr"></div> </b>

</words>

<words id="complex_complex_2">
	<span style="line-height:1.3em; display:block;">
		
		Unlike our earlier "fake news" <icon name="red"></icon> contagion,
		this contagion <icon name="yellow"></icon> does <i>not</i> spread to everyone!
		The first few people get "infected", because although they're only exposed to one
		binge-drinker, that binge-drinker is 50% of their friends. (yeah, they're lonely)
		In contrast, the person near the end of the chain did <i>not</i> get "infected",
		because while they were exposed to a binge-drinking friend,
		they did not pass the 50%+ threshold.

		<div style="height:0.75em"></div>

		The <i>relative</i> % of "infected" friends matters.
		<i>That's</i> the difference between the <b>complex contagion</b> theory<ref id="complex"></ref>,
		and our naive it-spreads-like-a-virus <b>simple contagion</b> theory.
		(you could say "simple contagions" are just contagions with a "more than 0%" infection threshold)

		<div style="height:0.75em"></div>

		However, contagions aren't necessarily bad &mdash;
		so enough about crowd <i>madness</i>, what about...
		<next>...crowd <i>wisdom?</i></next>

	</span>
</words>

<words id="complex_complex_3">

	Here, we have a person <icon name="blue"></icon> who volunteers to... I don't know,
	rescue people in hurricanes, or tutor underprivileged kids in their local community, or something cool like that.
	Point is, it's a "good" complex contagion.
	This time, though, let's say the threshold is only 25% &mdash;
	people are willing to volunteer, but only if 25% or more of their friends do so, too.
	Hey, goodwill needs a bit of social encouragement.

	<br><br>

	<b>&larr; Get everyone "infected" with the good vibes!</b>

</words>

<words id="complex_complex_3_end">
	<span style="line-height:1.3em; display:block;">

		<b>NOTE:</b> Volunteering is just <i>one</i> of many complex contagions!
		Others include: voter turnout, lifestyle habits, 
		challenging your beliefs,
		taking time to understand a issue deeply &mdash; anything
		that needs more than one "exposure".
		Complex contagions aren't <i>necessarily</i> wise,
		but being wise is a complex contagion.

		<div style="height:0.75em"></div>

		(So what's a real-life <i>simple</i> contagion?
		Usually bits of trivia, like, "the possum has 13 nipples"<ref id="possum"></ref>)

		<bon id="contagions"></bon>

		Now, to <i>really</i> show the power and weirdness of complex contagions, let's revisit...

		<next>...an earlier puzzle <div class="rarr"></div> </next>

	</span>
</words>

<words id="complex_cascade">
	Remember this? This time, with a <i>complex</i> contagion <icon name="blue"></icon>, it'll be a bit tougher...

<words id="complex_post_cascade">
	Now, you may think that you just need to keep adding connections to spread any contagion,
	"complex" or "simple", good or bad, wise or mad.
	But is that really so? Well, let's revisit...

<words id="complex_post_cascade_end">
	<next wiggle>...another earlier puzzle <div class="rarr"></div> </next>
</words>

<words id="complex_prevent">
	If you hit "start" below, the complex contagion <icon name="blue"></icon> will just spread to everyone.
	No surprise there.
	But now, let's do the <i>opposite</i> of everything we've done before:
	<b>draw a network to <i>prevent</i> the contagion from spreading to everyone! <div class="darr"></div></b>
</words>

<words id="complex_prevent_2">
	You see?
	While more connections will always help the spread of <i>simple</i> ideas,
	<b>more connections can hurt the spread of <i>complex</i> ideas!</b>
	(makes you wonder about the internet, hm?)
	And this isn't just a theoretical problem. This can be a matter of life...
</words>

<words id="complex_prevent_end">
	<next wiggle>...or death. <div class="rarr"></div> </next>
</words>

<words id="complex_groupthink">
		
	The people at NASA were smart cookies.
	I mean, they'd used Newton's theories to get us to the moon.
	Anyway, long story short, in 1986,
	<i>despite warnings from the engineers</i>,
	they launched the <i>Challenger</i>,
	which blew up and killed 7 people.
	The immediate cause: 
	it was too cold that morning.

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	The less immediate cause: the managers ignored the engineers' warnings.
	Why? Because of <b>groupthink</b><ref id="groupthink"></ref>.
	When a group is <i>too</i> closely knit, (as they tend to be at the top of institutions)
	they become resistant to complex ideas that challenge their beliefs or ego.

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	So, that's how institutions can fall to crowd madness.
	But how can we "design" for crowd <i>wisdom?</i>
	In short, two words:

	<next>Bonding &amp; Bridging <div class="rarr"></div> </next>

<!-- Bonding & Bridging -->

	<h3>
	A quick response to James Surowiecki's <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i>
	</h3>

	<div>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/surowieki.jpg" width="200" height="300" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	
	First off, I'm not dissing
	<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds">
	this book.</a>
	It's a good book, and Surowiecki was trying to tackle the same question I am:
	<b>“why do some crowds turn to madness, or wisdom?”</b>

	<br><br>

	Surowiecki's answer: crowds make good decisions when everybody is as independent as possible.
	He gives the story of a county fair,
	where the townsfolk were invited to guess the weight of an ox.
	Surprisingly, the average of <i>all</i> their guesses was better than any <i>one</i> guess</i>.
	But, here's the rub: the people have to guess <i>independently</i> of each other.
	Otherwise,
	they'd be influenced by earlier incorrect guesses,
	and the average answer would be highly skewed.

	<br><br>

	But... I don't think "make everyone as independent as possible" is the full answer.
	Even geniuses, who we mischaracterize as the most independent thinkers,
	are deeply influenced by others. As Sir Isaac Newton said,
	<i>“If I have seen further, it is by standing on the sholders of Giants.”</i>

	<br><br>

	So, which idea is correct?
	Does wisdom come from thinking for yourself, or thinking with others?
	The answer is: "yes".

	<br><br>

	So that's what I'll try to explain in this explorable explanation:
	how to get that sweet spot between independence and interdependence &mdash;
	that is, how to get a wise crowd.

<bonus id="connections">

	<h3>
	What other kinds of connections are there?
	</h3>

	<div>

	For the sake of simplicity,
	my simulations pretend that people can only be connected through friendships,
	and that all friendships are equal.
	But network scientists <i>do</i> consider other ways we can be connected, such as:

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/connection1.png" width="250" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>Directional connections.</b> Alice is the boss of Bob, but Bob is not the boss of Alice.
	Carol is the parent of Dave, but Dave is not the parent of Carol.
	"Boss" &amp; "parent" are <i>directional</i> relationships:
	the relationship only goes one way.
	In contrast, "friends" is a <i>bidirectional</i> relationship:
	the relationship goes both ways. (well, hopefully)

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/connection2.png" width="250" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>Weighted connections.</b> Elinor and Frankie are mere acquaintances.
	George and Harry are Best Friends Forever.
	Even though there's a "friendship" connection in both cases, the second one is stronger.
	We say that these two connections have different "weights".

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/map.png" width="200" height="200" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	Just remember: <b>all these simulations are wrong.</b> The same way any map is "wrong".
	You see the map on the left? Buildings aren't gray featureless blocks!
	Words don't float above the city! However, maps are useful not <i>despite</i> being simplified,
	but <i>because</i> they're simplified. Same goes for simulations, or any scientific theory.
	Of <i>course</i> they're "wrong" &mdash; that's what makes them <i>useful</i>.

	</div>

</bonus>
<bonus id="contagions">

	<h3>
	What other kinds of contagions are there?
	</h3>

	<div>
	
	There are so, so many ways that network scientists can simulate "contagions"!
	I picked the simplest one, for educational purposes.
	But here's other ways you could do it:

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/contagion1.png" width="250" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>Contagions with Randomness</b>.
	Being "exposed" to a contagion doesn't <i>guarantee</i> you'll be infected,
	it only makes it more <i>likely</i>.

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/contagion2.png" width="250" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>People have different contagion thresholds.</b> 
	My simulations pretend that everyone has the same threshold for binge-drinking (50%) or
	volunteering (25%) or misinformation (0%). 
	Of course, that's not true in real life, and you could make your sim reflect that.

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/contagion3.png" width="250" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>An ecology of contagions.</b>
	What if there were <i>multiple</i> contagions, with <i>different</i> thresholds?
	For example, a simple "madness" contagion and a complex "wisdom" contagion.
	If someone's infected with madness, can they still be infected with wisdom?
	Or vice versa?
	Can someone be infected with both?

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/contagion4.png" width="250" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>Contagions that mutate and evolve.</b>
	Ideas don't pass perfectly from one person to another the way a virus does.
	Like a game of Telephone, the message gets mutated with each re-telling &mdash;
	and sometimes the mutant will be more infectious than the original!
	So, over time, ideas "evolve" to be more catchy, copy-able, contagious.

	“[small world networks] helped John F. Kennedy (barely) avoid nuclear war!”
	</h3>

	<div>

	Besides the NASA Challenger explosion, the most notorious example of groupthink
	was the Bay of Pigs fiasco.
	In 1961, US President John F. Kennedy and his team of advisors thought
	&mdash; for some reason &mdash;
	it would be a good idea to secretly invade Cuba and overthrow Fidel Castro.
	They failed.
	Actually, worse than failed: it led to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962,
	<i>the closest the world had ever been to full-scale nuclear war.</i>

	<br><br>

	Yup, JFK really screwed up on that one.

	<br><br>

	But, having learnt some hard lessons from the Bay of Pigs fiasco,
	JFK re-organized his team to avoid groupthink.
	Among many things, he:
	1) actively encouraged people to voice criticism,
	thus lowering the "contagion threshold" for alternate ideas.
	And
	2) he broke his team up into sub-groups before reconvening,
	which gave their group a "small world network"-like design!
	Together, this arrangement allowed for a healthy diversity of opinion,
	but without being too fractured &mdash; a wisdom of crowds.

	<br><br>

	And so, with the same <i>individuals</i> who decided the Bay of Pigs,
	but re-arranged <i>collectively</i> to decide on the Cuban Missile Crisis...
	JFK's team was able to reach a peaceful agreement with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
	The Soviets would remove their missiles from Cuba, and in return,
	the US would promise not to invade Cuba again.
	(and also agreed, in secret, to remove the US missiles from Turkey)

	<br><br>

	And that's the story of how all of humanity almost died.
	But a small world network saved the day! Sort of.
